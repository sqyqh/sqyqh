### 卄乇ㄥㄥㄖ, 几乇尺ᗪ丂.

I store most of my personal work on [my own :tea: Gitea instance](https://git.elyat.im). By the way, if you don't know what Gitea is, [take a look at it](https://gitea.io/), it's nice and you won't encounter problems like [this one](https://www.eff.org/fr/deeplinks/2020/11/github-reinstates-youtube-dl-after-riaas-abuse-dmca).

**H/ppy h/cking!**

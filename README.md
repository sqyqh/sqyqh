### Hello, nerds. :yarn: 

I'm here (and on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/sqyqh)) to monitor some repositories and share content for my students like sources, courses, slides, exercises...

I store most of my personal work on [my own :tea:Gitea instance](https://git.elyat.im). By the way, if you don't know what Gitea is, [take a look at it](https://gitea.io/), it's nice and you won't encounter problems like [this one](https://www.eff.org/fr/deeplinks/2020/11/github-reinstates-youtube-dl-after-riaas-abuse-dmca).

**Happy hacking!**
